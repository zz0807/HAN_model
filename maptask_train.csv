q2ec4,178,instruct,g,when you get to the b-- when you get below it go up towards your ha-- outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line s-- sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the page ,
q2ec4,179,ready,f,right so ,
q2ec4,180,check,f,it's a diagonal across the page towards that ,

q2ec4,218,explain,g,i would imagine ,
q2ec4,219,explain,f,'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the left ,
q2ec4,220,acknowledge,g,aye right okay ,
q2ec4,221,check,g,so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing ,
q2ec4,222,reply_w,f,the gold mine is ,
q2ec4,223,check,g,right above the noose ,
q2ec4,224,reply_y,f,mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description ,
q2ec4,225,acknowledge,g,okay ,
q2ec4,226,ready,g,well-- ,
q2ec4,227,instruct,g,from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit ,
q2ec4,228,check,f,on its right-hand side ,
q2ec4,229,align,g,if you know what i mean ,
q2ec4,230,reply_y,g,yeah ,
q2ec4,231,check,f,so that's like towards the edge of the paper here ,
q2ec4,232,reply_y,g,mmhmm ,
q2ec4,233,acknowledge,f,right there we go ,
q2ec4,234,align,f,i've come right down below that ,
q2ec4,235,reply_y,g,yeah ,
q2ec4,236,query_yn,g,then you don't have anything else down like ,
q2ec4,237,reply_w,f,i've got the saloon bar and i've got the stone creek directly across to the left of the noose er but i've got nothing else in that area at all ,
q2ec4,238,acknowledge,g,uh-huh ,
q2ec4,240,acknowledge,g,right ,
q2ec4,241,reply_w,f,you know like below that i should say i mean in the m-- in the middle and to b-- above them and the stone slabs ,
q2ec4,242,acknowledge,g,okay ,
q2ec4,243,ready,g,right ,
q2ec4,244,align,g,you know how the like on line with the saloon bar ,
q2ec4,245,reply_y,f,mmhmm ,
q2ec4,246,explain,g,about two inches along i've got a swans pond ,
q2ec4,247,acknowledge,f,right ,
q2ec4,248,query_yn,f,so i've to avoid that ,
q2ec4,249,reply_y,g,you want to avoid that ,
q2ec4,250,instruct,g,so ,
q2ec4,251,query_yn,f,so go above it ,
q2ec4,252,reply_y,g,need to go go up above it ,
q2ec4,253,instruct,g,and then down and under the saloon bar to the finish ,
q2ec4,254,acknowledge,f,phoar ,
q2ec4,255,align,g,is that you ,
q2ec4,256,reply_y,f,that's it yeah ,
q2ec4,257,acknowledge,g,yee-ha ,
q2ec4,258,ready,g,okay ,
q2ec4,259,uncodable,g,home boy let's see you done ,
q2ec4,260,explain,f,what the first bit of that was a total disaster ,
q2ec4,261,explain,g,he'll probably kill me here ,
q2ec4,262,explain,f,'cause i came through the rift valley the wrong way i was supposed to come from the top and go down 'til like down through it ,
q2ec4,263,acknowledge,g,yeah ,
q2ec4,264,explain,f,'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down there ,
q2ec5,1,ready,f,right ,
q2ec5,1.1,ready,g,right mm ,
q2ec5,2,query_yn,g,have you got a missionary camp down the bottom ,
q2ec5,3,reply_y,f,yes ,

q2ec5,5,reply_y,f,mmhmm ,
q2ec5,6,acknowledge,g,right ,
q2ec5,7,reply_y,f,that's right ,
q2ec5,8,ready,g,okay well ,
q2ec5,9,instruct,g,you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it ,
q2ec5,10,acknowledge,f,right okay ,
q2ec5,11,align,g,okay ,
q2ec5,12,instruct,g,down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map ,
q2ec5,13,acknowledge,f,right ,
q2ec5,14,align,g,okay ,
q2ec5,15,ready,g,now ,
q2ec5,16,query_yn,g,you have you got a some gorillas over on the left ,

q2ec5,20,query_yn,g,do you think that's probably the same ,
q2ec5,21,reply_y,f,yeah that's probably about it ,
q2ec5,22,acknowledge,g,mm yeah ,
q2ec5,23,instruct,g,so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree ,
q2ec5,24,explain,f,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that ,
q2ec5,25,acknowledge,g,right okay ,
q2ec5,26,explain,f,right nothing else kind of down there ,
q2ec5,27,acknowledge,g,right ,
q2ec5,28,check,f,and i want to stop directly below ,
q2ec5,29,reply_y,g,yeah ,
q2ec5,30,ready,g,well ,
q2ec5,31,instruct,g,actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map ,
q2ec5,32,acknowledge,f,mmhmm ,
q2ec5,32.9,acknowledge,f,right that's okay ,
q2ec5,33,align,g,okay ,

q2ec5,39,explain,f,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so ,
q2ec5,40,acknowledge,g,ah right ,
q2ec5,41,query_yn,f,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across ,
q2ec5,42,reply_y,g,yeah ,
q2ec5,43,instruct,g,if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge ,
q2ec5,44,acknowledge,f,right okay ,
q2ec5,45,instruct,g,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge ,
q2ec5,46,acknowledge,f,right fine ,
q2ec5,47,align,g,okay ,
q2ec5,48,instruct,g,down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch ,
q2ec5,49,acknowledge,f,right ,
q2ec5,50,explain,f,erm i don't know if i can do that without going in the river actually ,
q2ec5,51,acknowledge,g,oh yeah ,

q4ec5,211,instruct,g,beside the flagship can you do that avoiding whatever you've got underneath the pebbled shore ,
q4ec5,213,check,f,ehm does this does this curve follow th-- ,
q4ec5,214,instruct,g,that's towards the right ,
q4ec5,216,instruct,g,towards the left sorry ,
q4ec5,217,check,f,does the curve follow the coastline or does it f-- go the opposite way ,
q4ec5,218,reply_w,g,f-- it goes towards the edge of the paper ,
q4ec5,219,acknowledge,f,right ah right ,
q4ec5,220,check,f,and the the f-- the finish is just to the is between ,

q4ec6,50,reply_y,g,yeah ,
q4ec6,51,acknowledge,f,mmhmm ,
q4ec6,53,instruct,g,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden ,
q4ec6,54,uncodable,g,roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it ,
q4ec6,55,instruct,f,s-- ,

q4ec6,100,acknowledge,f,right i've done that ,
q4ec6,102,instruct,g,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box ,
q4ec6,103,acknowledge,f,mmhmm ,
q4ec6,105,instruct,g,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a ve-- a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake ,
q4ec6,106,acknowledge,f,mmhmm ,
q4ec6,107,explain,f,so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake ,
